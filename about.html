        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We are a family-owned small business specializing in construction-related projects at your home or business.</p>
        <p>With nearly a decade of experience in design and high-end construction in Naples, we have all the necessary skillsets and a vast network of subcontractors that will bring any vision to life.</p>
        <p>The number one focus at MGR Special Projects is customer service. Keeping the company small allows us to work closely with our clients and provide a unique, enjoyable experience that seems to have been lost in today's construction world.</p>
